# standards

A collection of configuration and documentation for writing code at Alchemy.

## General Guidelines

When working with any language all code and commit messages should be:

 - readable - code is read more than written, strive for readability
 - commented - explaining the logical / business context helps all maintainers
 - professional - do not use profanity or make disparaging remarks about 3rd parties
 - [atomic](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/atomic_commits_with_git) - code should be added and located in a logically organized fashion
