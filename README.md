# standards

A collection of configuration and documentation for writing code at Alchemy.

## General Guidelines

When working with any language all code and commit messages should be:

 - readable - code is read more than written, strive for readability
 - commented - explaining the logical / business context helps all maintainers
 - professional - do not use profanity or make disparaging remarks about 3rd parties
 - [atomic](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/atomic_commits_with_git) - code should be added and located in a logically organized fashion

### Formatting

Please utilize the [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) file. If using Atom, please utilize the [atom-editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig) plugin. If using VSCode, please utilize [`editorconfig-vscode`](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode). Please see [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/) for more integrations.
